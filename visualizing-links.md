1) What is the rule for underlining text that is not a link?

don't do it.tht is confusing to users don't do it.


2) How should the unvisited link color compare to the visited link color in terms of:
  a) Brightness
  Unvisited links should be more vivid, bright, and ave bright and bold colors and visited links should have dull and faded colors.

  b) Hue
  unvisited and visited links should be similar colors, different shades of the same colors as a rule.

  c) Visibility to color-blind users
  Make unvisited links brighter than visited links so even the color-blind are going to be able to notice the difference.


3) What is a "perceived affordance"? Hint: Google is your friend. (OK, not really, but the search is nice.)

Perceived affordance means how an object (usually on screen) suggests how it might be used. this is related to intuitive GUI design and stuff.


4) When can you safely eliminate underlines for links?

In navigation menus and other lists of links assuming they look like conventional navigation elements.


5) Should you use blue for text? Why or why not?

No. as a general rule blue is the color used to identify links and using blue text for non-links would cause confusion.


6) If for some shocking reason, your contextual links are not underlined (horrors!), what can you do to improve link discovery by users?

By signaling clickability. this often means to have some kind of animation or visual change occur when the cursor passes over the link.


7) What are link titles and how might you use them?

They are a small pop up containing text info when a user hovers a cursor over a link.
