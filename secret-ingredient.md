I can safely say that trust and empathy can be the most important thing depending on the work place. When I was in the army you had to understand one another like family, this could be the difference between life and death. you had to trust your mates to have your back and you had to have empathy for your brothers in arms, there was no choice, you did everything with them, hell you lived in the mud with them. the funny thing was that when you assigned us as a group to any task we could do anything. we were the perfect example of a fully functioning unit. I feel that this shows the sheer importance of trust and empathy, I think more than most I know the vlue of these values.

As a bonus, it makes life easier in general when you can trust those around you and you have empathy for them.
