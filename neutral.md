Read the material and I really don't give such concepts the time of day. I do not use gender neutral language. I see everyone as equals and don't see the need to talk in a precious manner. When I hear non gender neutral language I don't take any note of it. I personally think that if I refer to everyone as "guys", and someone takes offense, they are too uptight and not worth paying attention to.
