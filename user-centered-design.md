1 Design for the users and their tasks

when designing the application or program or whatever, make if for your target user, there is no point making an app you think is great but the people who you made it for don't like it.

2 Be consistent

stick to conventions and stuff. make your program the same all the way through, if you have one style somewhere try keep it. there is no point having the same button on on each page of a website for example but it is always in a different place. tht is just confusing and bad practice.

3 Use simple and natural dialogue

Don't make the GUI full of junk or stuff not needed all the time. if there are lots of tools or buttons or something hide them in logical groups within menus and stuff. use plain speak, don't fill your stuff up with technical jargon.

4 Reduce unnecessary mental effort by the user

have an easy user interface, have a simple way of doing things. don't design an app or website or whatever that only a savant can use.

5 Provide adequate feedback

if a user presses a button they should see the button be pressed, if you tick  a box There should be a tick in a box, if a user submits a form a dialogue box should pop up to say successfully submitted. make it so a user knows when it has worked.

6 Provide adequate navigation mechanisms

make it so a user can easily and logically get about your software. websites with home buttons on every page and stuff like that are great. same with websites that have a nav bar (usually at the top of a page) that are the same no matter which page you are on and provide access to places easily. if parts of your software are hard to find, access or whatever then it is shit, same with if you cannot get back to or from somewhere.

7 Let the user drive

make the software in a way the user can do as much as the please within reason.

8 Present information clearly

group things in a way that makes sense, do not clutter shit all over the place.

9 Be helpful

make your stuff to be self explanatory, maybe even provide a help button or something to help with obscure stuff.

10 Reduce errors

if a user encouters an error, let them know what it was clearly. also make your stuff so that you cant add letters in a box that is meant for numbers and that kind of thing.
