these results weren't all that surprising, the colors that failed we hard to read and the ones that passed were easier to read. In some cases they may be hard to tell the difference but this tool would make it easy to decide, also some of the colors that passed may be acceptable for contrast but wouldn't be considered aesthetically pleasing.
